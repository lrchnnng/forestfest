## UX 

### Strategy
The first plane of UX is **strategy**. This builds the foundation on which the rest of the planes are built, focusing on the main goals of the website.

#### Business goals
1. To sell tickets to the user
2. To show the user images of previous years
3. To promote featured artists for the event
4. Encourage the user to sign up to the newsletter

#### First Time and Recurring User goals
1. Easily find the price of the tickets
2. Clearly see the dates of the event
3. View the line up of the event
4. Sign up to the newsletter
5. Navigate to social media pages for more information and images

### Scope
The second plane of UX looks at the **scope** of the website. What does the user have to do in order to reach the goals for the website. Do they need to search? Do they need to sign up to a newsletter?

### Structure
Flow of website, a site map, description of interaction

### Skeleton
The **skeleton** plane of UX design is a more visual representation of the flow in which a user might use the website. Using wireframes to show a basic design layout 
removes colour, Typography, imagery to create a basic view of website and layout

## Testing
---
- **User Stories**
- **Lighthouse**
- **HTML and CSS Validation**
- **Known bugs and fixes**
    * Struggled to get social media icons to show from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/). Re linked the stylesheet using the link from Code Institute, Love Running Project and the icons have appeared.
    * When creating responsive artist info cards on tickets.html I found that one side of the grid increased in height while the other side stayed the same. Fixed by specifying width in percentages rather than relying on auto.
    * I had used buttons with anchor elements in order to link to separate pages, this did not pass the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) so I removed button elements and styled the remaining anchor elements to appear as buttons.
