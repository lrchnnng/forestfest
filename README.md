## Testing

- **User Stories**
- **Lighthouse**
- **HTML and CSS Validation**
- **Known bugs and fixes**
    1. Struggled to get social media icons to show from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/). Re linked the stylesheet using the link from Code Institute, Love Running Project and the icons have appeared.
    2. When creating responsive artist info cards on tickets.html I found that one side of the grid increased in height while the other side stayed the same. Fixed by specifying width in percentages rather than relying on auto.
